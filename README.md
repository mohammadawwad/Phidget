# Phidget
programming Phidget devices (similar to arduino kits) from buttons, to credit card machines, and LCD screens in multiple languages. For my programming (final project)

Once connected and the project starts working, it will be organised into languages and projects featuring many different devices, once completed a demo video will be made.

YouTube Demos: to be added soon
